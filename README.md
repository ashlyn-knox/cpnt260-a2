## Review Notes
* I had some problems with a few of the checkbox hacks that I was working on. I will need to review transitioning out of the viewport for a smoother navigation hack, and I will continue to work on making the cards flip. At present they are set up to start adding this functionality. The end goal is for there to be an ingredients list on the back of the card that is visible from hitting the list button overlay. The entire card will link to a full recipe.
